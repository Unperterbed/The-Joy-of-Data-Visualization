# Getting Started

There are a few tools you'll need to install to take full advantage of this book.

## Interactive and Replicable

This book is intended to provide replicable code for reproducing most examples in R and Python. In R, the primary graphing libraries are [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/). In Python, the primary graphing libraries are [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

Throughout this book, you'll find mini-apps that let you look under the hood to see the exact code used to create an example, like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_app('https://alt-f11.shinyapps.io/dual_plot_test/', height = '600px')
```
