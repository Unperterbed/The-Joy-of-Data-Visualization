# Anatomy of Data

## What is data? What is information?


## Where does data come from?
All around you!

## What are the types of data?
There are several frameworks to describe different types of data. The Stevens Typology (Stevens, 1946) is the most common among social scientists, so I'll use its language throughout this book. Stevens describes four types of data:

  * Ratio (salary in USD, height in inches, etc.)
  * Interval (attitude scales, Celsius and Fahrenheit, etc.)
  * Ordinal (strongly agree > strongly disagree, Freshmen < Senior, etc.)
  * Nominal (job title, country of birth, etc.)
  
These characteristics of data are the bedrock for all visualizations. Most graphs only work with certain types of data, so being able to identify these properties in your data will help you more quickly understand the myriad ways you can represent it visually. Let's go into a little more detail about each type.
  
_Nominal_ data has no known magnitude or rank order. For instance, we might look at the GDP for a group of countries. Country is a nominal collection of data because the country names simply indicate that the countries are different from one another. Other examples:

  * College degree (psychology, business, literature, etc.)
  * Colors (red, green, etc.)
  * Vehicle manufacturers (Tesla, Audi, Mercedes, etc.)
  

_Ordinal_ data has an unknown magnitude but a known rank order. Consider a marathon where each runner is given a rank once they finish. We know that the runner who came in first place had a better time than the runner in second place, but we don't know how much faster they were. Were they twice as fast? Only one second faster? We don't know, and that's what makes this data ordinal. Other examples:

  * Agreement scales (strongly disagree < strongly agree)
  * Job seniority (CEO > vice president > manager)
  * Academic grades (A > B > C)


_Interval_ data has a known magnitude and rank order. The Celsius temperature scale is a common example of this, with the range from 0 to 100 degrees providing an even gradient to express the amount of heat. We know that 35 is more than 28.5, and that the difference is 6.5 units. Other examples where interval data might be collected:

  * Happiness scales
  * Job satisfaction surveys
  * Personality tests
  
_Ratio_ data has a known magnitude and rank order, just like interval data. The difference between these two is that interval data does not have a meaningful zero value, but ratio does. When the temperature reaches 0 degrees (in Celsius), does that mean that there is no temperature? Of course not! The 0 in Celsius is a useful baseline for us in our day-to-day lives, but it isn't an accurate expression of how quickly a group molecules are vibrating. However, the Kelvin temperature scale was intentionally designed to be a ratio scale, which is why 00 degrees Kelvin is called "absolute zero" and indicates the complete absence of temperature. Here are a few other examples you might come across:
  * Salary (in dollars)
  * # Products sold
  * miles per hour

Most people struggle to spot the differences between ratio and interval data, and that's okay. It rarely matters for visualizing data, but can be important for other types of data analytics, which is why it's worth mentioning. There are also some data that can move between categories, such as time or geospatial data. We'll cover these in more detail in the examples in a later chapter.

The kinds of charts you can build depend on the type of data you want to visualizate. This table gives a (non-exhaustive) sampling of the plots that might work for each combination of two variables:

Variable 1  | Variable 2   |   Graphs
------------- | -------------   |     -------------
Nominal    | Nominal          |   Chord diagram
Nominal        | Ordinal      |   Stacked barplot
Nominal   |   Interval    |   Spider plot
Nominal   |   Ratio   |   Jitter plot
Ordinal   |   Ordinal   |   Heatmap
Ordinal   |   Interval    |   Boxplot
Ordinal   |   Ratio   |   Barplot
Interval    | Interval    |   Lineplot
Interval    | Ratio   |   Scatterplot
Ratio   |   Ratio   |   Log-Transformed Scatterplot


  
  
## How do we visualize data?
We create a graph of data by *encoding* the values into various visual properties, such as:

  * Color
  * Length/Width
  * Area
  * Text
  * Angle
  * Position
  And more!
  
Data visualization is the final step in a process of encoding natural phenomena into data and then translating data into visual properties.

Information is always lost in translation, and data visualization is no exception. Sometimes, we fail to capture important information about the phenomena into the data we store. For instance, you may have taken an employee experience survey that asked you to "rate your job satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10 (highest)." The data we capture is incredibly simple (an integer between 1 and 10), but your holistic experience on the job is rich and nuanced and detailed and diverse! A great deal of information about the phenomena we're interested in is *not* captured with this question. That doesn't mean it's a bad question, only that there's a gap between the reality of the phenomena and the data we've captured. We could ask the same question, but instead of requiring a numeric response, allow the employee to write a text response. This would certainly capture more information about their true experience, but this type of data is much more complex to work with and derive insights from. In this way, the data we capture is the first (and usually biggest) limitation on our ability to understand the world around us.

Other times, our visualizations fail to capture meaningful aspects of our data (and thus, the phenomena itself). After surveying 100 employees, we might use a bar plot to show that the average job satisfaction score is 9.2 out of 10. Yahoo! But the average score of all 100 employees is only one piece of information, and we might have several other questions: What was the lowest and highest scores? Did the scores vary by work team? Have scores gone up or down over time? How do these scores compare to other similar companies? And so on.

Generally speaking, more information is lost during the translation from reality to data than from data to visualization. Gathering data which faithfully and fully represents natural phenomena is difficult, tedious, and complex. Scientists spend years learning about a particular category of phenomena (medicine, biology, psychology, etc.) and being trained in the methods to capture meaningful data related to their discipline. This book mostly deals with the second phase of translation: data to visualization. It contains numerous examples of visualization techniques, describes the terminology and proper usage of various charts and graphs, and provides the statistical code to reproduce the examples in the R programming language.

This app demonstrates a few interactive ways to see how data is encoded into various properties.
