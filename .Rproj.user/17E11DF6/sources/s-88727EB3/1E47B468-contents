## Data Repositories

These sites contain numerous data files which can be very useful for practicing all sorts of technology skills. This is a "living" list (meaning it will be updated as I learn more) and are in no particular order:

  * [Google Public Data](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory)
  * [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
  * [Eastern Michigan University Data Directory](https://guides.emich.edu/data/free-data?fbclid=IwAR0td1ZU9iHsZZnjXrNad2OyCaOHa_FUdPyfmDrHBZkUmDFgsHS3oEbOeQE)
  * [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php?fbclid=IwAR0r8QYX-UOM-l9fL5XW_SxZ1U5zT0bWnMs6QKfKns24Wl7tGMUNQZ7XSmc)

(show table and scatter plot to demonstrate)
